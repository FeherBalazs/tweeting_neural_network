# tweeting_neural_network

I was reading the other day an article about recurrent neural net applications. They can do impressive things, such as witing drama like Shakespeare, compose music, and even write legitimate looking math papers and linux source code.  As I was also doing some sentiment analysis in R on Twitter data, I had the idea that maybe feeding neural networks vast amounts of tweets about the latest Star Wars installment could get them „tweet” about the movie. What could be the practical application of this trick? I think that reading up tweets generated by our neural network can give us a peek into a short synopsis of what hundreds of thousands of people feel about a given movie or product.
